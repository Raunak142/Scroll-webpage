## Code Overview  

### **Navigation Bar (`#nav`)**  
- Uses **flexbox** for proper alignment.  
- Adjusts spacing and size for mobile screens using **media queries**.  
- Includes **navigation items (`#nav2 h4`)**, with some hidden on smaller screens.  

### **Text Content (`#text-content`)**  
- Uses **horizontal scrolling (`overflow-x: auto`)** for an interactive text display.  
- Text size adapts based on screen width (`vw` units for font-size).  
- Custom **scrollbar styling** for better aesthetics.  

### **Image Section (`#image-content`)**  
- Ensures images **scale and maintain aspect ratio** (`object-fit: cover`).  
- Removes scrollbars for a clean look on mobile (`::-webkit-scrollbar { display: none; }`).  

### **Media Queries**  
- Adjusts font sizes, navigation layout, and spacing for screens **below 600px width**.  
- Hides certain elements and optimizes text readability on smaller devices.
